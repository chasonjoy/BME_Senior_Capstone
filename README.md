# BME_Senior_Capstone

This is the documentation for all Arduino code created for my team's Senior Undergrad Capstone Project: CPR Training Dummy with realtime feedback. The device will take in inputs from a variety of sensors and provide different means of feedback to the user to describe if their technique is correct and successful.
